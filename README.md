The Movie Review Platform is a full-stack web application designed to let users explore a collection of movies, watch their trailers, and engage with a review system that allows them to read and write feedback on each film. Users can browse through a visually engaging interface featuring a hero section and carousel that highlights popular or recent releases. For each movie, users can view a dedicated page that displays the trailer alongside user-submitted reviews and ratings, offering insight into othersâ€™ opinions before watching. The platform supports adding new reviews with written comments and star ratings, which are stored in a NoSQL database and displayed in real time. It provides a simple and interactive way to discover movies, decide what to watch based on peer input, and share personal thoughts with other viewers.
